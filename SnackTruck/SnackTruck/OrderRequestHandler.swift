    OrderRequestHandler - Handles order submission to the service
    Notes: This is intended to handle the sending and receiving of the
        order data to the SnackTruck ordering service. To simulate the
        callback from the service, I decode the created JSON from the
        order list as to pretend that its data being received. This
        is what is being displayed in the OrderConfirmationView in the
        success case.
 
    send() - This function can be manipulated to show the error case in
        OrderConfirmationView by changing success to false.
 
    getConfirmedOrder() - Returns the parsed SnackData list in a successful
        order
